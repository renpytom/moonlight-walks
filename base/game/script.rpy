    "It was the summer before I started college. I had spent the past
     two years studying, taking tests, and applying for admission."

    "Now, for the first time in a while, I had a little downtime. So I
     decided to take the opportunity to explore America."

    "But, since I was broke, my plans were quickly scaled
     down to spending the summer at my aunt and uncle's house, on
     a small island known as North Sand Island."

    "North Sand Island was a barrier island in the Atlantic ocean. It
     was remote enough that there wasn't even a bridge to it, just a
     ferry that ran a few times a day."

    "Being such a small island, there wasn't all that much to do. But
     the solitude was nice, and I found ways to pass the time."

    "One thing I did was to take pictures with my digital camera. On
     the night of the full moon, I decided that I wanted to capture
     the moonrise."

    "So I went out to the beach just before the moon came up, set up my
     camera on a tripod, and locked in the appropriate shutter speed
     and f-stop."

    "Every few seconds as the moon rose, I used the remote that came
     with my camera to snap another frame showing the moon and its
     reflection in the water."

    "It only took a few minutes for the moon to rise over the horizon,
     but I kept at it for a while longer."

    "Finally, I was done. I started packing up my camera
     and my tripod, to get ready to head back to my aunt and
     uncle's house."

     else walking down the beach."

    "I could tell that it was probably a girl or a woman from the long
     white dress she wore, but from that distance it was hard to tell
     anything else about her."

    "I decided to stay a bit to see who it was. In all the times I've
     gone out stargazing, I'd never met anyone just walking
     down the beach in the middle of the night."

    "At that late hour, most people were either at home, or in a
     town with other people. You hardly ever saw people by
     themselves."

    "The only time I've seen someone else on the beach at night would
     be when they are watching the stars or the satellites go by."

    "But those people stay still and look up at the sky, while this
     girl was looking down at the ground in front of her, watching
     where she was going."

    "I ran through a number of crazy scenarios in my head. Maybe she
     had some disease that meant she couldn't be out in the sun. Maybe
     she was looking for buried treasure."

    "It only took me a few seconds to dismiss these. What was the
     chance of them actually happening?"

    "I waited for a while, as she slowly made her way down the
     beach. I didn't think such a slow walk could be for
     exercise, but I had no idea what else she could be doing out
     there."

     her, using the telephoto lens on my camera."

     age, a year or two younger or older at the most, and in perfect
     shape."

    "Her skin was flawless, if a bit pale, and her hair was very
     light, almost as white as the long dress she was wearing."

    "Together, the combination of pale skin, light hair, and a white
     dress made her seem to glow in the moonlight."
